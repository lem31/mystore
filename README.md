**Overview** <br>

My Store App is an e-commerce web application built using React and Vite. It enables users to browse products, add items to their cart, favorite products, checkout and pay. Users are also able to view a product page dedicated to individual products, which provides them with more details about the product and a list of related products beneath. The app uses Zustand for state management, MUI for UI components, and integrates form validation with Yup and React Hook Form.
